`Sintaxera` is the creative alias of Ty Paulhus, an artist known for his eclectic and vibrant works that span paintings, illustrations, sketchbooks, printmaking, and tattoos. Based in New England, Ty’s artwork is characterized by bold, expressive line work and strong use of black. He has developed a unique visual language made with combinations of mark-making, writing, and iconography that is constantly evolving into new forms while also referencing and sampling existing themes. Finding joy in the imperfections inherent in the human hand, Ty explores the ideas of language, censorship, nature, and decay.

The name sintaxera was born long ago, spawned from days immersed in graffiti, skateboarding, comics, and punk rock. A “syntax error” is an error in code written in programming languages. That idea of being out of place, broken, and glitching resonated, and the pseudonym was fully embraced (spelled with a Rhode Island accent, naturally).
